     *   every respect except that the size is fixed. If the stack size is n, the bottom
     *   element is lost when the n+1 element is pushed onto the top. Implement a drop-out
     *   stack using links, by modifying the LinkedStack code that you completed
     *   as part of Lab 3.
     *
     *   The driver should create a stack of moderate size (say five) and push on that many
     *   String elements consisting of peopleâ€™s names (include your own).
     *   Output the contents of the stack and the results of the size() and peek() operations.
     *   Push two more elements onto the stack, outputting the contents and the results of
     *   the size() and peek() operations for each. (Adapted from PP 13.8.)
