# Lists and Iterators 

This assignment makes use of the classes defined in java.util to implement stacks and queues using both array lists and linked lists. This assignment requires the student to create stacks and queues with both array lists and linked lists respectively. 

Detailed Requirements Description: 

For the questions below, use the classes defined in java.util rather than the list classes developed in the textbook. Make the container in your stack or queue class of the type indicatedâ€”do not use inheritance. You must implement the StackADT and QueueADT interfaces from the textbook. Code a separate driver for each question, but use the same testing values. Make sure you demonstrate each of the methods for the respective interface.

Implement a stack using a java.util.LinkedList. (Adapted from PP 15.2.)

Implement a stack using a java.util.ArrayList. (Adapted from PP 15.3.)

Implement a queue using a java.util.LinkedList. (Adapted from PP 15.4.)

Implement a queue using a java.util.ArrayList. (Adapted from PP 15.5.)
