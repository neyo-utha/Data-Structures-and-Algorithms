# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains all five assignments covering the breadth of the content from the course COMP2231 Data Structures and Algorithms at Thompson RIvers University. All assignments received 100% and full marks were achieved. The final mark achieved in the course itself was 93%. 
  <br /><br />For reference purposes, the textbook used in the course is the 5th edition of "Java Foundations: Introduction to Program Design and Data Structures" by John Lewis, Peter DePasquale and Joseph Chase.  
  <br />In each sub-directory the "Files" folder is synonymous with the "src" folder in any IDE. To run the assignments simply copy the relevant files into the 'src' folder in the IDE of your choice.
