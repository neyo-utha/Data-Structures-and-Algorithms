# Trees and Binary Search Trees

In this assignment the student needed to demonstrate the creation of a unique Decision Tree, creation of a linked binary search tree class and finally a method which will balance an inputed unbalanced binary search tree which may be either a left or right-sided degenerate tree. The balance method must produce a balanced binary search tree from the inputted degenerate tree. 

Detailed Requirements Description: 

1.a) Complete the implementation of a DecisionTree, introduced in Chapter 19. This will require completing a number of methods from the source code for this chapter, particularly for LinkedBinaryTree. Your initial test should be the BackPainAnalyzer output from Listing 19.6 on page 746. Show test cases for at least two other correct traversals of this tree. 

1.b) Develop and demonstrate another decision tree that is more complex the BackPainAnalyzer tree. Provide at least two correct traversals of this tree, as well.



2.a) Complete all missing methods in LinkedBinarySearchTree. Show test cases for all implemented methods being sure to include edge cases for methods where applicable.

2.b) Then, implement a balance tree method for this class using the brute force method described in Section 20.5 of your textbook. Show test cases for two different degenerate trees, outputting the height of the tree before and after balancing the tree. Then, demonstrate insertions into a balanced tree that result in degenerate trees and rebalance the tree again.
